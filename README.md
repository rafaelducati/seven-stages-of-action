# Seven stages of action

**Seven stages of action** is a term coined by the [usability](/wiki/Usability "Usability") consultant [Donald Norman](/wiki/Donald_Norman "Donald Norman"). He explains this phrase in chapter two of his book _[The Design of Everyday Things](/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things "The Design of Everyday Things")_, in the context of explaining the psychology of a person behind the task performed by him or her.

With a foot in psychology, Norman explains the userâ€™s cognitive process as she/he interacts with technology in daily life using, among others, a model called seven stages of action to explain how human beings interact with the physical world.

The intent of this project is to demonstrate the seven stages of action applied to the user experience in web front-end interaction design for a specific application.

The identified steps are:

1.  Forming the goal
2.  Forming the intention
3.  Specifying an action
4.  Executing the action
5.  Perceiving the state of the world
6.  Interpreting the state of the world
7.  Evaluating the outcome
